## What is 15 Puzzle?

A "15 Puzzle" is a sliding puzzle in which there are 15 squares on a 4x4 board and the object is to keep moving the squares until the desired position is reached.

A 3x3 board is called an "8 puzzle" or a 5x5 board is called a "25 puzzle".

### What are the rules of the puzzle?

Basically, you are only **allowed to move frames around by using the gaps between empty frames**, and you are not allowed to remove multiple frames and rearrange them in the **same way as in other sliding puzzles.**

One method of solving the puzzle is to **put the top part of the puzzle in the desired position first, and then solve the bottom part recursively**. This method can be used by everyone from beginners to advanced solvers.
